# Programming2
For this program, I used the following add-ons: pandas, numpy, seaborn, IPython.display, and matplotlib.pyplot. However, all the code files submitted are .ipynb files, heance they have import module commands written in and are designed to be read as jupyter notebooks.

The dataset contains data on patients (identified by 'personId' numbers 1-100 with age and sex data provided) with information on whether they had experienced a certain factor in the prior year and then some predicted risks of certain diseases.

patient_risk_profiles.csv is the raw dataset I chose.

The file 'Read_data.ipynb' contains the initial dataset and the code to transform it into more easily handled data files. Please run this file first as it will save some csv files which will be required for the subsequent data manipulation and visualisation.

Data_summaries.ipynb contains some statistics about the data, no actual plots of the data

Each subsequent visualisation_#.py file contains the code for a different visualisation/plot.
