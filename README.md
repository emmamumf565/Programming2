# Programming2
For this program, I used the following add-ons:
-pandas
-IPython.display
-numpy
-matplotlib.pyplot
-seaborn

The dataset contains data on patients (identified by 'personId' numbers 1-100 with age and sex data provided) with information on whether they had experienced a certain factor in the prior year and then some predicted risks of certain diseases.

The file 'Data_manipulation.py' contains the initial dataset and the code to transform it into more easily handled data.


Each subsequent visualisation_n.py file contains the code for a different visualisation/plot
